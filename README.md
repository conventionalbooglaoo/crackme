/*
 * CRACKME CHALLENGE INFORMATION:
 * 
 * This is an medium difficulty crackme with multiple protection layers:
 * 
 * 1. String obfuscation using XOR encryption
 * 2. Anti-debugging using ptrace detection
 * 3. Timing attack detection
 * 4. Signal-based debugger detection (SIGTRAP)
 * 5. Process forking for additional anti-debugging
 * 6. Self-modifying code behavior
 * 7. Control flow obfuscation with function pointers
 * 8. Multiple validation stages with complex mathematical operations
 * 9. Decoy functions to mislead static analysis
 * 10. Multi-layer validation requiring all checks to pass
 * 
 * The correct key is 16 characters long and must satisfy multiple
 * mathematical relationships simultaneously.
 * 
 * Hint: The correct key is "R3v3rs3_M3_H4rd!"
 * 
 * Compile with: gcc -o crackme crackme.c -O2
 * For debugging: You'll need to bypass multiple anti-debugging mechanisms
 * 
 * Educational purposes only - for learning reverse engineering techniques.
